This chatbot is designed to assist customers with their queries. A knowledge base containing common customer queries for a fictitious telecom company is considered as a basis for RAG.

We named the AI Assistant as **Wong AI**
## Why Wong AI?
Our team's name is **Avengers**, and **Wong AI** is a reference to the character **Wong** (part of the **Avengers team of superheroes**) from the **Marvel Cinematic Universe**, 
who is known for his wisdom and ability to assist others. The name reflects our goal of creating an AI assistant 
that is helpful, knowledgeable, and reliable. ðŸ˜Š

## Objectives
- To provide a user-friendly interface for customers to get assistance with their queries.
- To ensure quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries.
- To create guardrails for responses from the knowledge base only
- To maintain a professional and helpful tone in all interactions.
- To create a prototype that can be further developed into a full-fledged application.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The chatbot is designed to be easy to use, allowing customers to quickly find the information they need.
- **Quick Responses**: The chatbot is capable of providing instant responses to customer queries, reducing wait times.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: The chatbot is integrated with a knowledge base to provide accurate and relevant information.
- **User Experience** - Customizable UI (Dark & Light mode), SShortcuts for frequently asked questions

## Technologies Used
- `Python`: The primary programming language used for developing the chatbot.
- `Chainlit`: A framework for building chatbots and other conversational applications.
- `OpenAI`: Used for natural language processing and understanding.
- `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `JSON`: For data interchange and storage.
- `ChromaDB`: A vector database for storing and retrieving knowledge base information.

## Important Design Decisions
- Single Knowledge Base in the form of Excel file. (Scalable storage solution can be implemented in production)
- RAG is implemented using in-memory ChromaDB collection for quick access to knowledge base information.
- Guardrails are implemented to ensure that the chatbot only responds with information from the knowledge base.
- Chainlit is used due to its rich conversational capabilities and flexible deployment options.
- OpenAI is used as LLM provider (Any other LLM provider can be used as well, such as Azure OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
- Detailed logging is implemented to track user interactions and responses for future improvements.
- Multi-modal support is out of scope for the current prototype, but can be added in future iterations.

## Next Steps (Production Readiness):
### Deployment Options
Chainlit allows multiple deployment options, including:
- Deploy as a **web app**
- Deploy as a **Slack app**
- Deploy as a **MS Teams app**
- Deploy as a **Discord app**
- Deploy as a **React app** for integrating with existing web applications
- Deploy as a **Copilot** (As a sidebar in existing applications)

More details can be found in the [Chainlit documentation](https://docs.chainlit.io/deploy/overview)

In addition, a deployment pipeline with continuous testing must be built (covering unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, security tests, and performance tests) to ensure the chatbot is production-ready.

### LLM/OpenAI
- Build content filtering for bias, toxicity, abusive language, and other harmful content.
- Build guardrails for Copyright compliance and data privacy.


## Appendix
### Known `limitations / Out of scope` in the current prototype
- No audit trail of interactions with LLM.
- No user authentication or authorization.
- Support queries requiring complex reasoning or multi-turn conversations may not be handled effectively.
- The chatbot does not have a fallback mechanism for queries that cannot be answered by the knowledge base.
- The chatbot does not currently support multi-language queries or responses.
- The chatbot does not have a mechanism for handling user feedback or ratings.
